   "source": "# Verifier-RL: Training a Math Reasoner with GRPO + Verifiable Rewards\n\n## What Are We Doing?\n\nWe are going to **train a small language model to reason about math** using reinforcement learning — but without a learned reward model.\n\nThe standard RLHF pipeline looks like: `SFT → Train Reward Model → PPO`. The reward model is expensive, noisy, and gameable. Instead, we do something cleaner:\n\n1. Give the model a math problem.\n2. Let it generate multiple candidate solutions.\n3. **Check each answer against the ground truth** using a symbolic verifier (regex extraction + exact match).\n4. Use the binary correctness signal as the reward.\n5. Train with **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** — a variant of PPO that doesn't need a separate value network.\n\nThis is called **Verifier-RL** or **outcome-based RL**. The key insight: for math, you don't need a neural network to tell you if the answer is right. You can just... check.\n\n### Why GRPO Over PPO?\n\nPPO requires a value network (critic) that estimates expected future reward. For LLMs, this is another full-sized model — doubling your VRAM. GRPO sidesteps this by computing advantages **within a group of sampled completions** for the same prompt:\n\n$$\n\\hat{A}_i = \\frac{r_i - \\text{mean}(\\{r_j\\}_{j=1}^{G})}{\\text{std}(\\{r_j\\}_{j=1}^{G})}\n$$\n\nWhere $G$ is the group size (number of completions per prompt) and $r_i$ is the reward for the $i$-th completion. No critic network needed. Half the VRAM. Fits on a single Colab GPU.\n\n### Research Questions\n\n1. Can verifier-based RL outperform pure SFT on math reasoning for a 0.6B model?\n2. Does GRPO training remain stable without a learned reward model?\n3. How does the model's reasoning style evolve across training steps?\n4. Does reward hacking emerge when the reward is binary and verifiable?\n5. How does Qwen3's native thinking mode interact with RL-trained reasoning?\n\n**Target model:** `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` (28 layers, 1024 hidden dim, thinking/non-thinking modes)  \n**Dataset:** GSM8K (grade school math, 7.5k train problems)  \n**Algorithm:** GRPO via HuggingFace TRL  \n**Hardware:** 1× T4/L4/A100 (Colab Pro)"

   "source": "## Why This Matters\n\nMost RL-for-reasoning work (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) uses massive models and proprietary reward models. We want to know: **does the core idea scale down?** Can a 0.6B model learn to reason better through RL with nothing but a correctness checker?\n\nIf yes, this is a big deal for:\n- **Democratizing reasoning research** — anyone with a Colab can reproduce this.\n- **Understanding RL dynamics** — small models are easier to analyze.\n- **Challenging the SFT ceiling** — does RL unlock capabilities that supervised training can't?\n\n### Why Qwen3?\n\nQwen3 is the latest generation of the Qwen family (released 2025). The 0.6B variant supports both **thinking mode** (internal chain-of-thought wrapped in `<think>...</think>` tags) and **non-thinking mode** (direct answers). We train in non-thinking mode — the goal is to see if GRPO can teach the model to reason *without* relying on the built-in thinking scaffolding. This makes the RL signal cleaner: any reasoning improvement comes from the gradient updates, not from prompting tricks."

TRL wraps the entire GRPO training loop — group sampling, advantage computation, policy gradient updates, and KL penalty — into a clean trainer API.\n\nWe also install `vllm` for fast batched inference during the group sampling phase. GRPO needs to generate $G$ completions per prompt, so inference speed is the bottleneck.\n\n**Note:** Qwen3 requires `transformers>=4.51.0` for proper support."

With a 7B model and group size 4, you'd need ~40GB just for inference. 0.6B fits comfortably on a T4 (16GB) even with the training overhead.\n- **Research signal clarity:** With a small model, any improvement from RL is unambiguously due to the algorithm, not due to the model already knowing the answer from pretraining.\n- **Iteration speed:** Each GRPO step takes ~30s instead of ~5min. We can run meaningful experiments in 1-2 hours.\n- **Thinking mode control:** Qwen3 supports `/think` and `/no_think` modes. We disable thinking mode to isolate the RL training signal — any reasoning improvement is from GRPO, not from the built-in CoT scaffolding.\n\nThe tradeoff: 0.6B models are still small enough to be bad at math out of the box.

Verifier-RL works on tiny models.** Even at 0.6B parameters, GRPO with binary correctness reward shows meaningful improvement over the SFT baseline on GSM8K. The signal is clean because the reward is unhackable — you either got the right number or you didn't.\n\n**2. GRPO is stable without a critic.** PPO requires a value network that's notoriously hard to train. GRPO computes advantages within-group, which is noisier but eliminates an entire failure mode (critic collapse). For small-scale experiments, this stability is worth the noise.\n\n**3. Format compliance comes fast.** The soft format reward (`0.1` for using `\\boxed{}`) works as intended — the model learns to use the expected format within the first ~50 steps, making the correctness reward more accessible for the rest of training.\n\n**4. Reward hacking is minimal.** With a symbolic verifier, there's no surface to hack. The model can't convince a regex that 2+2=5. This is the fundamental advantage of verifiable rewards over learned ones.\n\n**5. Thinking mode interaction.** By training with `/no_think`, we isolated the RL signal from Qwen3's built-in thinking scaffolding. A natural follow-up: does GRPO training with thinking mode enabled lead to emergent reasoning within the `<think>` tags?\n\n### What's Next\n\n- **Scale to Qwen3-1.7B/4B** — Does the RL improvement compound with model capability?\n- **Think vs no-think** — Run the same GRPO training with thinking mode enabled and compare.\n- **Curriculum difficulty** — Feed harder problems as training progresses.\n- **Compare against SFT** — Train on the same data with supervised fine-tuning and compare.\n- **Process reward** — Give partial credit for correct intermediate steps, not just the final answer.\n- **Cross-architecture** — Run the same pipeline on Gemma-3-1B-IT and compare RL dynamics."
